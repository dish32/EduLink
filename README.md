Project Name: EduLink
Project Description:
EduLink is a Student Management System built in Java using a Linked List data structure and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Java Swing. It allows teachers and administrators to efficiently manage student information without using complex databases.

With EduLink users can:
Add new students with ID, name and marks

Display all students dynamically
Search students by ID
Delete students from the system
The project uses a Linked List to store student records dynamically, allowing fast insertion and deletion without worrying about array size limits. The GUI makes the system user-friendly, interactive and visually appealing.
EduLink is designed for schools, colleges or training institutes where simple, fast and efficient student data management is needed. It also serves as an educational tool to demonstrate object-oriented programming and data structures in a real-world application.
